Summary of the Client and Their Requirements
The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company that helps clients with personalized financial plans. They needed secure software to protect sensitive client data. Specifically, they wanted to implement a file verification step using a checksum and secure communication through HTTPS.

Identifying and Addressing Vulnerabilities
I identified software vulnerabilities by running a dependency-check tool and examining the code manually. I also added a checksum feature to verify data integrity and implemented HTTPS to secure communication. Coding securely is important to protect sensitive information, prevent data breaches, and build trust with clients. Secure software improves a companyâ€™s reputation and reduces risks of costly attacks.

Challenges and Insights from the Vulnerability Assessment
The most challenging part was understanding the vulnerability report and deciding which issues to focus on. This step helped me learn how to prioritize security fixes and improve my coding practices.

Adding Layers of Security
I added layers of security by implementing HTTPS and generating a checksum using SHA-256. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and vulnerability databases to identify risks and decide on the best ways to fix them.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
I ensured the application was functional and secure by running it to confirm that features like checksum and HTTPS worked. After refactoring, I used a dependency-check tool to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

Tools and Practices for Future Use
I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and coding practices such as secure encryption and certificate management. These tools and techniques will be useful in future tasks for maintaining security in software projects.

Demonstrating Work to Future Employers
I would show future employers how I implemented secure coding practices, such as using HTTPS and checksum verification, and how I identified and fixed vulnerabilities. This demonstrates my ability to write secure, reliable, and professional-grade software.
